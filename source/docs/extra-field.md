## Styles

This starter template comes pre-loaded with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a utility CSS framework that allows you to customize and build complex designs without touching a line of CSS. There are also a few base Sass files in the `/source/_assets/sass` folder, set up with the expectation that you can add any custom CSS into `_documentation.scss`.
